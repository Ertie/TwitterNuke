Ever found yourself bored in quarantine? Or maybe with an account with tweets from 2013 you wanted to give a second chance?

If both are true, try this on for size.\
This will loop through your tweets, from last to first, and delete or unretweet accordingly.

### Getting it working:

__As of Node.js v12.16.1__, the way to run files with this importing method uses Node's `--experimental-modules`.

So you would run a Node instance in the folder with the line:

`node --experimental-modules .`

Remember to fill the corresponding tokens at Token.json. You'll find these at the App's "Keys and tokens". Refer to Twitter's API documentation for more steps on this.
